    "\n",
    "In an ocean, there are `n` islands some of which are connected via bridges. Travelling over a bridge has some cost attaced with it. Find bridges in such a way that all islands are connected with minimum cost of travelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can assume that there is at least one possible way in which all islands are connected with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be provided with two input parameters:\n",

    "1. `num_islands` = number of islands\n",
    "    \n",

    "1. Create a blank `minHeap`, and push any one island (vertex) into it.  \n",
    "1. While there are elements remaining in the `minHeap`, do the following:\n",
    " - Pop out an island having smallest edge_cost, and reduce the heap size. You can use `heapq.heappop()` for this purpose. \n",
    " - If the current island has not been visited before, add the `edge_cost` to the `total_cost`. You can use a list of booleans to keep track of the visited islands.  \n",
    " - Find out all the neighbours of the current island from the given `graph`. Push each neighbour of the current island into the `minHeap`. You can use `heapq.heappush()` for this purpose. \n",
    " - Mark current island as visited\n",
